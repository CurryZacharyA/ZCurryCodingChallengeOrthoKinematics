	A user can't copy and paste the url to the main code challenge page without
	having logged in with the right credentials.

• Try not to use helper methods for string manipulation, try to write your own algorithms
---I wasn't sure what is meant by a helper method. I tried my best to use this simplest
	methods and few extensions of methods. I could've used a RegularExpression or "helpermethod"
	to search through the strings, but I used a switch instead.

• Include documentation on how to call your api
---I've uploaded it to a running AWS instance. The ASP pages can be hosted on any kind of server.
	I've used AWS in school but Microsoft Azure or a Linux based server would work just as
	well. Options are not limited to what I've listed. In my case, enter the url or have a link
	to the url, enter the correct credentials to access.

• Include test cases and the results in your solution
